A Project made with: HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also one my first experiences using an API to fetch data!

This was also my first using debounce in javascript! I was unfamiliar with debounce before I started this project, it was a challenge working through it and making sure everything was right but I'm sure it'll be easier next time!

The autocomplete.js file is a function that can be used anywhere to display dropdown menues! The code is made so it can fit any project.
